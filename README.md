##Question (KPIs)
-> fatalities and their proportion according to the kind of vehicle and accident severity.
->Vehicle type-specific casualties.
->patterns in monthly casualties to compare the two years.
->Maximum Casualties by Road type.
->Casualty distribution by surface of the road.
->Relationships between Casualties by Day/Night and by Area/Location.

##Steps Followed: -
Here's my approach to the project:
1. Data Cleaning: - Eliminated mistakes, duplication, and inconsistencies to guarantee correct data.
2. Data Processing: New columns were made to arrange the data and provide insights.
3. Data Analysis: Utilized statistical techniques to glean insightful information.
4. Data Visualization: I was able to construct interactive charts and graphs using Excel as my visualization tool.
5. Dashboard Creation: To facilitate user engagement, an Excel dashboard with timelines and slicers was created.

##Key Insights: -
1. Total Casualties that took place after the accident: - 417,883
2. Max Casualties by Car: 333,485 (79.8%); Min by Others: 3,424
3. 2021 & 2022 Casualties: 222,146 & 195,737
4. Peak Casualties: Nov 2021 & Nov 2022; Min: Feb 2021 & Jan 2022
5. Max Casualties: Single Carriageway; Min: Slip Road
6. Most Casualties: Dry Road surfaces
