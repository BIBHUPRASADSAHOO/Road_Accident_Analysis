<a herf="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NwJdgh_XDgZZ-b0wO4upN_c6V6dZ-eUn/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=110809561979917201661&rtpof=true&sd=true"> Dataset </a>

##Question (KPIs)
-> fatalities and their proportion according to the kind of vehicle and accident severity.
->Vehicle type-specific casualties.
->patterns in monthly casualties to compare the two years.
->Maximum Casualties by Road type.
->Casualty distribution by surface of the road.
->Relationships between Casualties by Day/Night and by Area/Location.

##Steps Followed: -
Here's my approach to the project:
1. Data Cleaning: - Eliminated mistakes, duplication, and inconsistencies to guarantee correct data.
2. Data Processing: New columns were made to arrange the data and provide insights.
3. Data Analysis: Utilized statistical techniques to glean insightful information.
4. Data Visualization: I was able to construct interactive charts and graphs using Excel as my visualization tool.
5. Dashboard Creation: To facilitate user engagement, an Excel dashboard with timelines and slicers was created.

##Key Insights: -
